This is the backend API for a Quiz Web App built using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to register, log in, create quizzes, add multiple-choice questions, and fetch quiz data dynamically. The API is organized across three main PHP files: user.php for handling registration and login, quiz.php for creating, editing, retrieving, and deleting quizzes, and question.php for managing questions and their options. All data is stored in a MySQL database, and the connection is handled in db.php.

The database includes tables for users, quizzes, questions, options, and scores, all linked through proper foreign key relationships. All endpoints accept POST requests using x-www-form-urlencoded format. Responses are returned in JSON for easy integration with any frontend.

This backend was tested using Postman and built to support integration with a separately developed HTML/CSS/JS frontend. The project also includes the original SQL schema file and an image of the database design for reference. To run the backend locally, you simply need to start a PHP development server and connect it to your MySQL instance using the credentials in db.php.
